Users can sign up for a new account with Auth0, which will allow them to see the available items that have been posted to the site and contact the itemâ€™s owners.  The user can also post, update, delete, and view their own items.  This website was created with a React and Tailwind.css frontend, and a backend built with Node, Express, MySQL and Sequelize.  I built this project with the help of four other contributors in an agile environment utilizing a Trello board. My responsibilities included project management, implementation of authorization, creating React components, writing the API routes which connected our frontend to our MySQL database, deploy the application to Heroku, and connect the database using JawsDB.",

The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express and deployed to Heroku. The database was constructed with MySQL and implemented to Heroku with JawsDB. The HTML templating was completed with Handlebars. The app allows the user to enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This enters the burger's information into the MySQL database. When a burger is created, it is added to the available burger menu, and it's default 'devoured' status is set to false. When the user clicks the 'Devour' button to eat a burger, then it changes the saved 'devoured' boolen to false in the database, and the burger is moved to the 'devoured' menu.",
